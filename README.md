Mushroom identification is a popular activity among nature enthusiasts, hikers, and foragers who either intentionally search for mushrooms or encounter them by chance during outdoor excursions. For these individuals, being able to accurately identify mushrooms can be both a rewarding experience and an important safety measure, as some mushrooms are edible while others can be toxic. However, the task of distinguishing between different species and genera can be challenging due to the wide variety of mushrooms and the subtle differences in their appearance. This is where an automated identification system can prove to be quite helpful, providing a reliable and accessible way for individuals to classify mushrooms on the go using their smartphones or other devices.
    
    In biological classification, \textit{genus} is a taxonomic\footnote{Taxonomy is the branch of biology that classifies all living things. Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus developed a classification system called the taxonomic hierarchy, which today has eight ranks from general to specific: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species.\cite{taxonomy}} rank that groups together species that share common characteristics. It is one of the key levels in the hierarchical system of taxonomy, falling between family and species. A genus typically includes multiple species that are closely related but differ in certain morphological or genetic traits. For example, the genus \texttt{Agaricus} includes various species of mushrooms, such as \textit{Agaricus bisporus} (commonly known as the button mushroom), and \texttt{Agaricus arvensis} (the horse mushroom). These well-known species exemplify the diversity within the genus Agaricus. Genus-level classification is an essential step in identifying and studying fungi, as it provides a broader categorization that can be useful for understanding their ecological roles, potential toxicity, and other biological properties.

     In this report, we propose an approach that combines both local and global image features to improve the accuracy of mushroom classification. Our method integrates techniques such as the Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) and color histograms to create robust feature representations for mushroom images, which are then used for classification. The following sections will outline the methodology used, present experimental results, and discuss potential real-world applications of this classification system.
